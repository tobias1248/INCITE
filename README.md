# INCITE: INfluence-guided ConcolIc Testing for adversarial Examples

This repository is a fork of the original **[INCITE project](https://github.com/nccu-soslab/incite)** developed by NCCU SoSLab,  
which itself is built upon the open-source framework **[PyCT](https://github.com/alan23273850/PyCT)**.

It will serve as the working base for upcoming improvements and documentation efforts.

The original codebase is functional but lacks complete documentation, consistent structure, and some missing files.  
The goal of this repository is to:

- Reorganize the project structure for clarity  
- Restore missing components and dependencies  
- Add comprehensive code comments and usage guides  
- Ensure reproducibility and ease of use for future researchers  

This repository serves as a container for two sub-projects:
- `PyCT-Influence-CNN`
- `PyCT-Influence-Transformer`

Each sub-project will contain its own implementation, documentation, and step-by-step instructions.  
**Please navigate into each folder â€” detailed READMEs will be added soon.**

Stay tuned for updates.
